# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function.  The example shows a simple component that uses `useEffect` to log messages on mount and unmount. However, under certain conditions, the cleanup function might not be executed correctly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or memory leaks. 

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is crucial for managing side effects and preventing memory leaks.  In certain situations, particularly when the component unmounts prematurely or due to race conditions, this function might not always be called.

## Solution

The solution file provides a corrected version of the component that addresses the issue by ensuring the cleanup function is always executed properly.   Specific strategies to improve reliability and prevent unexpected unmounting are detailed in the solution file comments.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the console logs. 
6. Manipulate parent component or any other to trigger unexpected unmounts to observe error.

## Additional Notes

This example demonstrates a simplified scenario.  In more complex applications, subtle timing issues and component lifecycle interactions might cause similar problems.
